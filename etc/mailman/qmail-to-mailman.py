# qmail-to-mailman.py
#
# Interface mailman to a qmail virtual domain. Does not require the creation
# of _any_ aliases to connect lists to your mail system.

# This is free software under the GNU General Public License.
#
# This script is meant to be called from ~mailman/.qmail-default . It catches
# all mail to a virtual domain, in my case "lists.hams.com". It looks at the
# recepient for each mail message and decides if the mail is addressed to a
# valid list or not, and bounces the message with a helpful suggestion if it's
# not addressed to a list. It decides if it is a posting, a list command, or
# mail to the list administrator, by checking for the -admin, -owner, and
# -request addresses. It will recognize a list as soon as the list is created,
# there is no need to add _any_ aliases for any list. It recognizes mail to
# postmaster, mailman-owner, abuse, mailer-daemon, root, and owner, and
# routes those mails to MailmanOwner as defined in the configuration
# variables, above.
#
# INSTALLATION:
#
# Install this file as ~mailman/bin/qmail-to-mailman.py
#
# To configure a virtual domain to connect to mailman, create these files:
#
# ~mailman/.qmail-default
# |preline /usr/bin/python /usr/lib/mailman/bin/mail-in.py
#
# /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains:
# DOMAIN.COM:mailman
#
# Note: "preline" is a QMail program which ensures a Unix "From " header is
# on the message.  Archiving will break without this.
#
# Replace DOMAIN.COM above with the name of the domain to be connected to
# Mailman. Note that _all_ mail to that domain will go to Mailman, so you
# don't want to put the name of your main domain here. In my case, I created 
# lists.hams.com for Mailman, and I use hams.com as my regular domain.
#
# After you edit /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains, kill and restart qmail.
#
